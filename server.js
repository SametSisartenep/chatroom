  Module dependencies:
  
  - Express
  - Http (to run Express)
  - Body parser (to parse JSON requests)
  - Underscore (because it's cool)
  - Socket.IO (Note: we need a web server to attach Socket.IO to)

  It is a common practice to name the variables after the module name.
  Ex: http is the "http" module, express is the "express" module, etc.
  The only exception is Underscore, where we use, conveniently, an underscore.
  Oh, and "socket.io" is simply called io. Seriously, the rest should be named after its module name.
